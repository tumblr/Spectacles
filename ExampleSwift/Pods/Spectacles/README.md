A tiny library for parsing JSON podspecs.

This only exposes a subset of podspec properties at the moment but could theoretically be expanded to include everything in the [specification](http://guides.cocoapods.org/syntax/podspec.html).

## Usage

```objc
TMPodspec *spec = [[TMPodspec alloc] initWithFileURL:
                   [[NSBundle mainBundle] URLForResource:@"Spectacles.podspec" withExtension:@"json"]];

self.label = [[UILabel alloc] init];
self.label.text = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%@ (%@)", spec.name, spec.version];
```

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Requirements

## Installation

Spectacles is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

    pod "Spectacles"
